# Triangle

Experimental Canvas art project.

While in auto mode, uses a timestamp to randomly activate triangles and occasionally change color.

In manual mode (activated on `mousemove`), user can draw on the triangular grid though they will be forced to watch their creations fade into nothingness like sandcastles at high tide.

Uses a [gist](https://gist.github.com/callumlocke/cc258a193839691f60dd) to scale according to device pixel ratio.
